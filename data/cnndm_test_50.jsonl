{"id": 0, "src": "(CNN)A New Jersey auction house has removed items from its April 17 event after an uproar from the public. The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by \"Star Trek\" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. \"There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly,\" the auction house said. \"We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue.\" Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page \"Japanese American History: NOT for Sale,\" he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. \"It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news,\" he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. \"For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research,\" she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. \"This was a gift and let the gift come full circle,\" said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. \"It should be returned as a gift.\" The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. \"Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason,\" he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. \"But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work,\" he added.", "tgt": "The items were originally given to a historian who opposed the camps, CNN affiliate reports .

{"id": 1, "src": "Ukip's election campaign chief has admitted that the party sometimes resembles a 'rugby club on tour' with members who can be 'boorish' and 'chauvinistic'. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters. As he launched the party's 'policies for women' alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and MEP Diane James, Mr O'Flynn was forced to defend its 'blokeish' image under Nigel Farage. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters . Polls suggest around 15 per cent of men are planning to back Ukip, compared to only 10 per cent of women. Mr O'Flynn: 'Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. 'But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. 'We're a very fast-growing party, we're increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we're not maximising our support in every potential group. 'And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we've got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.' The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is often photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer . The party used the event confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a 'tampon tax'. It also said it would give 'absolute, full and unconditional' support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are 'properly resourced'. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is 'accepted cultural practice' for some of 'our ethnic compatriots'. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party. She said: 'I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. 'There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. 'Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.' Suzanne Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party . Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as 'sluts'. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women's event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave.

{"id": 2, "src": "Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.", "tgt": "Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par . The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round .

{"id": 3, "src": "Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe .

Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season’s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. ‘I am happy we are through,’ said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. ‘But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him — I have been there, done that.’ Clarke did his best to ease Federici’s pain, too. ‘This is the life of a goalkeeper,’ said the Reading boss. ‘And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There’s every chance he’ll be Reading’s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. ‘We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I’m sure he’ll be as good as he always is.’ Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger’s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal’s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time . Federici’s mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate.

Reading’s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs’ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands.

{"id": 5, "src": "The Residence: Inside The Private World Of The White House . by Kate Andersen Brower . (Harper £18.99) For Americans, the White House is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get. For non-Americans, it is a respected power symbol,but not one to be especially loved. Kate Brower, an American journalist assigned to cover the Obama White House, became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching Downton Abbey.She set about interviewing the staff, who number at least 100, to build up a comparable picture of the American version of Upstairs, Downstairs. The staff all live out in Washington and commute in. The hours are long. Those on duty cannot go home until the President retires and goes to bed. So they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result. The pay is not great, but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends. Most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more. Ronald Reagan (pictured with his wife, Nancu) , on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours . The West Wing is the President’s office quarters; the East Wing belongs to the First Lady and her office staff. ‘The Residence’, as the living quarters are called, really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon. Keeping the organisation running smoothly, from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof, is a complex operation. It costs money — $13 million a year from government funds, plus a hefty contribution from the First Family itself. Presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests. They are also charged for dry-cleaning. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost. Jackie Kennedy was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’; while the Carters even asked the kitchen to serve them leftovers for their personal meals. The White House is never untenanted. The changeover of President takes place at 12 noon on Inauguration Day. Between then and 5pm, the entire moving out and in of the two families and their respective belongings has to be completed. The staff include ushers, chefs, maids, doormen, engineers, plumbers, full-time florists (the flower bill is enormous), even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script. But the glory of the place is its corps of butlers — six of them full-time, plus dozens more called in for big receptions, parties and dinners. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, Jackie Kennedy (pictured with her John F Kennedy) was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’ Most, by tradition, are black. There is a picture of ten of them taking a break between courses in their black ties. What is the collective noun for such a fine body of men? A bevy of butlers? The Kennedys and the Clintons liked staying up late and entertaining until 2am, which meant that those on duty didn’t get home until much later than that. This didn’t go down well. Oddly enough, the best-liked couple were the older Bushes — George H. W. and his wife, Barbara, who were used to having plenty of servants and were relaxed and genuinely concerned about them. The black staff, especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation, are especially proud to serve the Obamas as the first black presidential family. One found Obama and his wife, Michelle, celebrating gaining The White House on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by Mary J. Blige. And yet the Obamas have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff — even, says one, ‘stand-offish’. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours. He had a disconcerting habit of sitting around naked reading the newspapers. His wife, Nancy, by contrast, was a martinet who collected Limoges china. Woe betide anyone who broke a piece. She would call a servant to say that the lights needed turning on when the switch was within easy reach. When she was going to be difficult about the meal service, which was frequently, she would send for the chef, cock her head on one side and smile — and then find fault, usually with the desserts served by chef Roland Mesnier. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons (pictured) used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal - when Bill was relegated to the sofa in the study for a matter of time . Once, she decided at the last moment that the dessert for a state dinner should be sugar baskets each containing three sugar tulips. Chef Roland objected: ‘But there are only two days left until the dinner!’ She cocked her head: ‘Roland, you have two days and two nights before the dinner.’ Richard Nixon installed a bowling alley in the basement. He used to wander into the kitchens for a chat and discovered a washer-up who was also a keen bowler. They went on playing until 2am. Nixon then wrote a note to the man’s wife to explain why he was so late home. The Carters made news by appointing a convicted murderess as nanny to their daughter, Amy. Rosalynn Carter was convinced she was innocent, and the first family’s confidence was justified when the verdict was reversed. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal reached its height in 1998. For three or four months, Hillary made Bill sleep on a sofa in a study attached to the bedroom. Most women on the staff thought he’d got what he deserved. The feuding Clintons were the talk of the staff, who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms. Hillary’s voice screaming ‘Goddam bastard!’ was followed by a heavy thud. Much blood was discovered all over the bed. No one believed that her husband, who needed several stitches, had walked into a bathroom door in the dark, as he explained. ‘We’re pretty sure she clocked him with a book,’ said one member of staff. There were certainly plenty to hand — there were at least 20 on the Clintons’ bedside tables, including the Bible. But the biggest disturber of the peace was the huge bully from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded the assassinated J. F. Kennedy. He gloried in his size (6 ft 3 in) and his achievements. He had TV sets installed everywhere and kept several on loudly as he watched himself in the newscasts. He undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory, whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it. He drove the plumbers to nervous breakdowns over his shower. It was never hot enough nor strong enough for him. They replaced one after the other until the water came out as if from a fire hose and the heat generated set off the fire alarm. One water jet had to be aimed precisely at his penis (which he called ‘Jumbo’) and another up his rear end. He raged at the plumbers until he got satisfaction.

German detectives have been ‘closely monitoring developments’ in the £60 million London case and are expected to make contact with Scotland Yard this week. In particular, they are keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and, crucially, whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a £8.3 million robbery at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged . In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013 . There has been speculation that the London robbers – who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit centre – are from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, it is believed the Volksbank raiders, who have never been caught, are Polish. One of the five-man gang left a book at the crime scene – a Polish translation of American Desperado, the autobiography of drug smuggler Jon Roberts. And wooden boards used for their 100ft tunnel were bought in Poland. Thomas Neuendorf, of Berlin Police, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are very interested in the case in England and I’m sure our investigators will get in touch… If DNA matching our samples is put into the Interpol database by Scotland Yard we will be immediately notified.’ Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid . In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday . In the German case, the gang spent almost a year building their tunnel before drilling through the bank’s 3ft-thick concrete walls. In London, the robbers used heavy-duty drills to bore holes into a reinforced 7ft-thick wall. In both cases, police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Value of items taken, including jewels, said to be between £60m and £200m. Raid took place over three-day Easter weekend when workers had left building. 71 safety deposit boxes raided. Burglars used heavy duty drill to bore holes into a reinforced, two-metre-thick wall so they could gain access to boxes. Thieves dressed as workmen and gasmen. Police criticised after alarm ignored on Good Friday. Value of items taken, including diamonds, gold and silver, said to be £8.3m. Raid took place after thieves accessed the building while it was closed for the weekend. 294 security vaults broken into. Burglars also used drill to break through 3ft of concrete walls to break into the bank's strong room. The thieves disguised themselves as workmen.

Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the S-300 missile equipment ‘promptly’. The move is likely to anger both the U.S. and Israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons. Moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to Iran in 2010 after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, barring hi-tech weapons sales. Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with the air defence S-300 missile system (above), which could be used to protect nuclear sites . But the Russian president lifted the ban after Tehran struck an interim deal with Britain and five other countries to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework deal, reached this month, intended to significantly restrict Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons, while giving it relief from international sanctions. The negotiations have been heavily criticised by Israel which has warned against Iran having any nuclear activities. Russia signed the £545million ($800m) contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but later suspended their delivery because of strong objections from the U.S. and Israel. Vladimir Putin (above) gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the  equipment . The contract to deliver the system was heavily criticised by Israel and the U.S., who feared it could be used to protect Iranian nuclear sites. When it was cancelled, Iran filed a lawsuit with a court in Geneva, seeking £2.7billion ($4bn) in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not yet issued a ruling. Moscow said it had no choice but to annul the deal when the UN imposed sanctions, outlawing the sale of advanced weapons. Despite the sanctions, Russia and Iran have remained close allies. The deal on Iran’s suspected nuclear activities is supposed to be finalised by June 30. There is no firm agreement on how or when to lift the current sanctions. The announcement comes as the U.S. slammed Russia for flying a fighter jet close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an ‘unsafe and unprofessional manner’ last week. Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the incident over the Baltic Sea, in the international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot’s action were ‘unsafe and professional due to the aggressive manoeuvres it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed’, Mr Wright added. Russian officials reportedly denied their pilot did anything wrong. The incident was not first time the U.S. protested to Moscow what it considered to be an unsafe intercept. Last April, a Russian fighter jet intercepted a US reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk.", "tgt": "Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead  to supply the S-300 missile equipment .

{"id": 10, "src": "Scientists may have captured the song of a new species of whale living in the Antarctic. The song can’t be identified and doesn’t fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale, raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species. While beaked whales make up the second largest family of cetaceans, relatively little is known about them, mainly because they spend very little time on the water’s surface. Experts are sure the noise isn’t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales (stock image), because the signal doesn’t match . There are 22 species of beaked whale and all of them are elusive deep divers, meaning that they are most often identified by their songs, which they use to navigate. The mysterious ‘Antarctic BW29 signal was recorded near the Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, and Antarctic Peninsula by scientists led by Jennifer Trickey of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California, in La Jolla, California. They have recorded the noise more than 1,000 times to conclude that it’s unique in the composition of sounds making the signal and in timing, BBC Earth reported. ‘Given that new species of beaked whale are still being discovered, the source of these Antarctic signals might be a species that has yet to be identified,’ the study says. But the song belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray’s beaked whale (pictured), according to the study, despite the sound being the wrong frequency for a Gray’s beaked whale . Whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication. The word 'song' is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales. Only males 'sing'. While the complex sounds of the humpback whale and some blue whales are believed to be primarily used in sexual selection, all whales use simpler sounds all year round to communicate. Whales occupying the same geographical areas, which can be vast, tend to sing similar songs with only small variations. Male humpback whales have been described as 'inveterate composers' of songs and experts have said that their songs are similar to human music in many ways. Experts are sure the noise isn’t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales, because the signal doesn’t match their songs. But it could belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray’s beaked whale, according to the study, published in the Journal of Marine Mammal Science. It is very rare for strap-toothed wakes to be sighted as far south as the noises have been heard, while the noise is the wrong frequency for a Gray’s beaked whale, leaving the southern bottlenosed whale as the most likely match. But again there’s a problem, because the whale’s relative, the northern bottlenose whale, makes very different calls, leading experts to think that the southern species probably vocalises in a similar way – unlike the Antarctic BW29 signal. Experts have also recorded an ‘Antarctic BW37’ signal on six occasions, which is of a higher frequency. ‘It remains unknown whether this belongs to a different beaked whale species than the one producing Antarctic BW29,’ they write. Because frequency is usually linked to a whale’s size, there is a theory that the Antarctic BW29 song may be made by a southern bottlenose whale, while the higher pitched Antarctic BW37 song could be made by a smaller Gray’s beaked whale. There’s also a chance that new species of whale could sing at different frequencies, but this ability would be unique among beaked whale species. Last year, a study revealed that the shy Cuvier's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft (2,992metres) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven Empire State Buildings - and stays below for 138 minutes . A study published last April has revealed that the shy Cuvier’s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet. Scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal's dives, which was 9,816ft (2,992 metres) below the waves. And the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven Empire State Buildings on top of one another - for 138 minutes. The New York landmark measures 1,250ft (381 metres) in height, excluding its tip. It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects. Marine mammal biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California and followed them for several months as they dived for food.", "tgt": "Antarctic song doesn't fit the pattern of noise made by beaked whales .

Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11.

'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape.

A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a wild chase through San Francisco, and the suspects involved were still on the loose Saturday. Officers tried to stop the suspects' stolen car around 10pm on Friday just moments after they committed the latest in a series of robberies while armed with handguns, police said. But the car sped off with police in pursuit and struck a woman in a crosswalk, killing her.

Lucy, who, according to Heat magazine, is tipped to be making an appearance in the E4 show in the next few weeks, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL recently caught up with  the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns  Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Lucy models cut-out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar . Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren’t terrible but they also weren’t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it  hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout  incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have. I also want to increase my strength.' So how can we emulate her taut stomach? Ashton said: 'Lucy has a great flat tummy but isn’t looking for washboard abs. In our sessions, we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist. 'We then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked. On top of this, we add rotational movements such as seated twists. This ensures Lucy has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts.' He added: 'Lucy also ensures her diet is clean, luckily there wasn’t much we needed to change but its true what they say, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen.' Ashton and Lucy's typical workout  will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes. Lucy showed off her style credentials at the F&F AW15 show in London last week . Lucy has also been following a healthy diet, which she posts on her Instagram page, to complement her fitness regime. As her trainer says, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen . The duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press-ups. 'Every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury-free and we often throw in HIIT (high intensity interval training) finishers to add in a cardio element,' he said. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there'. He added: 'Everyone trains for different reasons. There are strong people, there are skinny people, but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies. Having people like Lucy show young females that you can enjoy life, eat well, train and reap the rewards is great.'

But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. \"He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,\" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online.

'Cover-up': Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties . Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry . The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: ‘Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.’ Last night, Channel 4 News – which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens – quoted him as saying: ‘Step very carefully, I’m not putting up with any more c**p about this.’ Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: ‘No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.’ Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year . The IPCC said: ‘We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.’ The Met said that after it received ‘a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens’ it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met’s statement added: ‘The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens’s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation . ‘This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.’ Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide ‘full, frank and truthful’ information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC’s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: ‘I’m hoping that this time they’re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen’s death.’ It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen’s killers – Gary Dobson and David Norris – to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were ‘serious concerns that… relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed’. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month . Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused the Met Police of being institutionally racist . In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence – something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that…relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.' Lord Stevens is now accused of failing to hand information over to the Macpherson public inquiry. He originally stated in 1998 that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption.", "tgt": "Mr Stevens accused of not giving information over to Macpherson inquiry .

Mrs Danczuk said women were turned off politics because there was no-one in Parliament like them. The glamorous Labour councillor, who is married to the outspoken MP Simon Danczuk, said Parliament needed people like her ‘to bring it back down to reality’. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen Karen Danczuk told LBC's Nick Ferrari (pictured) in Liverpool today that she aspired to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians . Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child. She said she used provocative selfie pictures on Twitter as a way of saying to others: ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am.’ Mrs Danczuk said she had rebuilt her life after the abuse, but now had the confidence to go into politics. She said: ‘There’s not many women that can relate to women. The women we do have in politics – and I’m not being rude to them because they’re really, really good – are they relating to ordinary women? I think they could relate a bit more.’ Mrs Danczuk became a hit on Twitter after posting a series of provocative photos of herself. She now describes herself as the 'selfie queen' Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child . Ms Danczuk was asked if she would go into mainstream politics and replied: ‘Yeah, I would. I think in some ways women like me need to, to bring it back down to reality.’ The mother of two said she didn’t agree with the way women politicians always talked about female issue like childcare. She said: ‘I don’t necessarily think we should assume that because you’re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. ‘Just speaking a language they understand – you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket – just speaking about everyday problems.’ She said: ‘Women that I speak to, there’s just nothing there for them to relate to.’ Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband . Mrs Danczuk, the Labour councillor and wife of MP Simon Danczuk, stopped for a drink at the Red Lion pub outside Parliament . Mrs Danczuk also spoke about the sex abuse abuse she suffered as a child and called for anyone who had gone through it to see a therapist. She said: ‘It shatters you – you trust no-one. You have nightmares. You can’t live a normal live.’ But she said therapy had helped. ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn’t wear low-cut tops – no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. ‘Your body has been taken away from you – they take your body, you lose control of it. It’s not a good place to be.’ She said she used to have ‘horrific nightmares’ every night and couldn’t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and ‘dealing with it’ had transformed her life. ‘I don’t think I’m God’s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I’ve took control of my life – because that’s what therapy does.’ She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. ‘It’s just been happy with you.

On Monday the nine-week-old puppy was given to three-year-old Sapphyre Johnson who is missing both of her feet. 'He's just like me!,' the toddler exclaimed with joy the first time she ever saw a photo of Lt. Dan. The dog's original owner Karen Riddle said that Lt. Dan, who was born with eight other puppies in a litter - and could have been euthanized. Missing their feet: Of the nine pups in the litter, Lt. Dan, named for the character in Forest Gump who lost his legs, was the only one missing a paw and Sapphyre Johnson had to have her feet amputated . On Monday, the nine-week-old puppy Lt. Dan without a paw found a new home with Sapphyre Johnson, a toddler who lost both of her feet . Just like me!: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan made fast friends on Monday and the two will grow up together at Sapphyre's family's home in Tennesee . Greenville Online reports that the puppy was named after a character in the film Forest Gump who lost both of his legs. Fellow breeders suggested to Riddle when Lt. Dan was born that he should be put down because he might be too sick to live. But Riddle didn't buy it. When the hound grew a little, Riddle was determined to find a home for him with someone with special needs. Because her father was a Shriner she called Shriners Hospital to see if there was a special needs child or wounded veteran who might want a pet in their home. Sapphyre, who is from Tennessee, has been in the hospital ever since she was just three-months-old. 'When I was seven months pregnant, they did an ultra sound and told us she may be missing some fingers and toes,' said Sapphyre’s mother, Ashley Johnson. 'They don't know what caused it,' she said. Different: Lt.Dan was the only one out of nine puppies who was born without a paw and fellow breeders suggested to his original owner that he be put down . Brilliant Idea: Rather than kill Lt. Dan because he was different, his original owner Karen Riddle suggested that he be placed in a home with a wounded veteran or special needs child . Playing and learning: 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' said an employee at Shriners Hospital . Shriners gives prosthetics and orthopedic services to children under 18 no matter what their family's income is. 'She had just two really long toes on each foot. And when she was 1, we had them amputated so she could be fitted for prosthetics,' said Sapphyre's mother. Shriners even suggested prosthetic leg could be made for Lt.Dan when he grows large enough. When Sapphyre saw a picture of her new puppy she knew that she had to have him and she felt an instant connection. 'The first time I showed her a picture of the dog, she looked at it for a moment, and she said, \"That's my puppy. He's just like me,\" ' said Elaine Hardin who works at Shriners. Best friends: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan only just met but from the looks of it they are already best friends . 'He's a special dog and he's going to a special child.' Hardin told Greenville Online that the dog will help Sapphyre make friends and will also help her to explain her disability to other kids. 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' Hardin said. 'Everybody loves dogs and they'll want to know about her dog that's special like her.' On Monday Saphyyre was so happy to have her new puppy. 'Lt. Dan, Lt. Dan,' she called out to her new furry friend. The puppy felt so at home with his new owners that it fell asleep in the car as Sapphyre made her way home to Tennessee with her family.

{"id": 30, "src": "Nigel Farage has called for any migrants rescued from the Mediterranean to be sent back to Africa. The Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now. Mr Farage urged Prime Minister David Cameron to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the Mediterranean by people-smugglers. Scroll down for video . The Ukip leader, on ITV's Lorraine this morning, said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now . He insisted the UK could not take more than 'a few thousand' genuine refugees. His comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled. Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy, described by UNHCR as 'the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded'. The Ukip leader's comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled . Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . Europe has been urged to copy Australia's military-led 'stop the boats' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. Australian PM Tony Abbott – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach Australia – said the EU should 'urgently' follow his lead. His hardline policy has proved controversial but Mr Abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on Saturday night. He said: 'The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats. 'That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the Mediterranean.' Conservative Mr Abbott won power in 2013 on a 'stop the boats' pledge, and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months. Operation Sovereign Borders involves the Australian Navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea, and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from. Mr Abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the United Nations over Australia's obligations to refugees, saying his policy was the 'most decent, most compassionate' solution. In the Mediterranean, callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by European nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back. Last year, Italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives. But the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions. EU leaders including David Cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a 'life or death' summit to solve the problem. The death toll from capsizing disasters stands at 1,727 so far this year - 30 times higher than the 56 fatalities by April 21 last year, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). At its recent rate the total for this year could reach 30,000. The Prime Minister and other European leaders are under mounting pressure to come up with a plan to stem the rising number of migrants killed trying to cross the sea for a better life in Europe. Mr Farage said Britain bore a burden of responsibility for the flow of migrants heading out of north Africa because of its military interventions in countries like Libya and Iraq. He said he was happy for Royal Navy ships to take part in search and rescue operations in the area, and for funds currently spent on overseas aid and EU contributions to be diverted to help people in the countries involved. But the Ukip leader told BBC1's Breakfast: 'The big message has to come from Italy, the big message has to come from Greece. The Australian prime minister said it yesterday: unless we send a message that we are not going to unconditionally accept unlimited numbers of people, they will keep coming. That's a decision that's got to be taken by the southern Mediterranean countries. 'What is the message from Italy and Greece? Is it that anybody that comes will be accepted? Because if it is, millions of people could be coming over the next couple of years. 'I'm suggesting that they should be making sure that those people coming in vessels that are not seaworthy should be put into vessels which are seaworthy and taken back to where they came from. 'There may be some cases where people genuinely need refugee status and if Britain has to give a helping hand and give, for example, some Christians refugee status ... then fine.' Asked how many refugees he would be willing for the UK to take, Mr Farage said: 'I would suggest a few thousand, because we as a country can't take unlimited numbers of people. The Prime Minister is going to be under intense pressure on Thursday for us to take really very big numbers and I am afraid we simply can't do that.' Mr Cameron has faced criticism for cutting funding for search and rescue operations in the area. The Times said British military chiefs were preparing to offer one of the country's biggest warships to help tackle the refugee crisis. HMS Bulwark, a 176-metre launchpad for helicopters and small vessels which protected London during the 2012 Olympics, is understood to be among the options being considered by ministers. An MoD spokeswoman said it was 'looking at options but no decisions have been taken'. The charity Save the Children has called on EU leaders to restart search and rescue operations off the coast of Italy within 48 hours, on the scale of the previous, and far larger, Italian-led Mare Nostrum operation. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone . Chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'EU leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet tomorrow. 'With every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations, the risk grows that more people will die as they try to reach Europe. 'We cannot allow 2015 to be the deadliest year in the Mediterranean yet. We must get agreement at Thursday's meeting to scale search and rescue back up to 2014 levels. 'Even one boat that sinks is one too many, but the escalating number of people dying off Italy's shores brings home the urgent need to act.' Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the response to events in the Mediterranean was 'inadequate' and Europe had to 'raise its game'. Two alleged people smugglers, including one believed to have been the captain of the ship which was wrecked at the weekend, have been detained by Italian authorities, according to reports. It has been claimed the boat capsized after accidentally colliding with another ship which came to its aid. Boris Johnson this morning called for more to be done to help the fleeing migrants . British special forces should be sent into Libya to lead Europe-wide action to tackle human traffickers, Boris Johnson has suggested. The mayor of London insisted action was required to 'choke off the problem at source' to stop migrants being put on to unseaworthy vessels to travel across the Mediterranean Sea from north Africa. He said: 'The first thing to do is to stop the people who are trafficking in human lives and I think sending over a warship - or whatever we're going to do - is entirely right. 'Myself, I'd like to see a real commitment to getting to grips with these people and round...' Host Nick Ferrari asked if this involved sending military personnel into Libya, Mr Johnson said: 'You need to do something about it.' Mr Ferrari countered: 'You're saying special forces into Libya.' Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm a long way away from the discussions about this but there are clearly some very highly organised and ruthless people who are sending people to their deaths in the Mediterranean. It seems to me that is something that should be the subject of concerted European response led by Britain.' Mr Ferrari interjected: 'We've got it - the SAS and SBS into Libya.'

Landmark Developments Ltd tore down a derelict property in Bath city centre and replaced it with a modern block of 14 flats. But residents complained that the development was three feet higher and four feet wider than the plans approved by the council. A brand new £4million apartment block in Bath (pictured) is facing demolition - because it is four feet wider than approved . Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building to be bulldozed. Dr Douglas Bernardt, a local resident with a PHD in architecture, described the situation as 'madness'. He said: 'I don't know how it was possible that things have got to this stage. 'Lots of money will have been spent on this and I can't understand why it was built different to what they had permission for. It's total madness. 'Architecturally I think there is nothing to complain about. The flats look nice, it's not aggressive to look at.' But Architect David Hadfield claimed the building was 1.5ft higher and just under three feet wider in some places than the approved plans. He said: 'Late in the design process the building’s insurers insisted on the introduction of a steel frame which resulted in the increase in width, and improved noise separation increased floor thicknesses adding to the height.' Planning permission for the development at 43 Upper Oldfield Park was granted in 2009 following three rejections since 2007.

Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building (right) to be bulldozed . The average price of a two-bedroom flat in the area is £289,000, meaning the 14 flats would be worth at least £3.9million on the open market. In October last year - as the building neared completion - residents complained that it differed from the  approved plans. Bath and North East Somerset Council halted construction and ordered Landmark Development to apply for retrospective permission. Planning officers said they thought the work was 'acceptable' and said permission should be granted. But the council's Development Control Committee disagreed and rejected the proposals on April 17, giving the developer six months to demolish the building. Architect David Hadfield submitted this drawing of the development showing the approved height and width in grey and the existing building in bold . The committee said it felt the development was 'harmful' to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Landmark Development is appealing against the decision and a  meeting will be held next week. Marc Willis, who is the developer's planning consultant, described the council's decision as 'unreasonable'. He said: 'The report suggests the complete demolition and it must be done within six months. The developer is very concerned and is doing everything to stop it. 'The planning officers said the plans were okay, but the council said no. The idea that they have ignored the officers is just wrong. 'We have been in constant dialogue with the council. Demolition goes well beyond what is needed to remedy the issue. 'There are 14 flats which should be on the market now, but you can't move in without planning permission. It is an expensive and unnecessary position to be in. 'If the council followed its officers, we wouldn't find ourselves in this situation.

'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinée performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.", "tgt": "Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .

All of a sudden, there was a little extra bounce in his box-fresh training shoes and a fire in his belly burned a little more fiercely. As a Chelsea player and coach, Clarke has fought hard across the capital with Arsenal over the years but through the first-half at Wembley, his Reading team struggled to match their illustrious opponents. They were flat. They backed off and defended, and offered a little too much respect to the team with the best form in the Barclays Premier League since the turn of the year. Steve Clarke applauds fans after his Reading side were narrowly beaten by Arsenal at Wembley Stadium . Arsenal have been irresistible since they improved at the back and supplied a stronger base for the flair of their many attacking stars to perform upon. Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, bought for a total of more than £70million, combined to open the scoring. What could Reading do with that sort of money? Ozil and Sanchez swaggered down the tunnel for the start of the second-half, deep in conversation, planning more damage but Reading stirred, found an equaliser and were able to add urgency to their game. Clarke sprang up and threw a punch of delight into the air on the touchline. His team were back in the contest and they contributed to a thrilling FA Cup semi-final. It was their first since 1927, so it would have been a shame to go home without a fight. As for Clarke, this must have felt good. He has been away from the cut-and-thrust of football’s elite since he was sacked by West Brom, but here he detected an FA Cup final as Wojciech Szczesny was unable to keep out a deflected volley from Garath McCleary. The Reading boss won the FA Cup with Chelsea in 1994, a game he considers a defining moment in the history of the West London club. Reading's Garath McCleary (bottom right) celebrates after scoring a shock equaliser against Arsenal . But Adam Federici's goalkeeping error enabled Arsenal to regain the lead in extra time . Clarke consoles his dejected keeper following the full-time whistle at Wembley . They barely looked back and were tightening their grip on a fourth Barclays Premier League title as Reading took Arsenal in extra-time. For all their quality, Arsene Wenger’s team still have vulnerabilities. Clarke, having learned much at the shoulder of Jose Mourinho, will have been aware of that. He will have been disappointed with the first-half display but hugely proud of their response and the desire they showed. In the end, Reading were unable to wreck Arsenal’s defence of the trophy or Wenger’s drive towards becoming only the second manager in history to win it six times, after George Ramsay with Aston Villa, all prior to 1920. But, as Clarke goes back to the Championship and a home game against Birmingham, he will take strength from this display and use it to inspire his return to the top-flight. Despite the defeat, Clarke will hope the performance will inspire a Premier League return .", "tgt": "Reading lost 2-1 against Arsenal in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley .

{"id": 34, "src": "Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival – including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name – and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet £10,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday – their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl – while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.", "tgt": "Prince Harry will  fly out of UK tonight to continue placement in Australia .

{"id": 35, "src": "It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the ‘exceptional circumstances’ get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here’s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches’ reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems . England hooker Tom Youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set-up . This is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the Galacticos at his club, but this situation cannot go on. England are being held hostage by their own edict, so why not just ditch the ‘exceptional’ clause and end the out-cry? Critics of the union’s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place. This column concurs with Conor O’Shea, who said: ‘It is pure populism to say it is World Cup year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that (policy), you break the dam. There are always exceptional circumstances. Then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one.’ Leicester’s England hooker, Tom Youngs added: ‘I don’t know how well it would go down with the team. Stuart has built a culture with this group of players. Does he want to disrupt it?’ The 'exceptional' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff . Fair point. Tell players they have to stay to be considered, then at the 11th hour perform a U-turn and select exiles; that is a short-cut to unrest, surely? This is no restraint of trade either – those who wish to go abroad can do so freely, but the knock-on effect is clear. Well, it is reasonably clear. It would be clearer still if the RFU and England really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely. Sam Burgess’s heavily-scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on Friday night, when he starts at blindside flanker for Bath against Newcastle at Kingston Park. He has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months, but his club’s head coach, Mike Ford, insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home. There are potential implications for Burgess’s quest to earn a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Lancaster sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre. Sam Burgess's rugby evolution continues on Friday as he starts at blindside flanker against Newcastle . However, despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon’s exploits to date in his new code, he will be included in England’s training squad announced next month, providing he is fit. That is a given. In addition, any further doubts about Manu Tuilagi’s health will further enhance Burgess’s prospects of making it to the World Cup – as a powerful ball-carrier who can break tackles and off-load. The England coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision, given three months to do so. Finally, the back-row experiment makes sense. Burgess needs the ball in his hands more, in order to make his presence felt, so wearing No 6 addresses that. When it comes to matchday atmosphere, the Stade Marcel Michelin is hard to beat . It is well documented that English clubs cannot compete with their French rivals when it comes to transfer-market clout, but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too. Last weekend, the cacophony at Stade Marcel Michelin – for Clermont vs Northampton – was on a different level to anything experienced here. In this observer’s opinion, the noise and colour at Stade Felix Mayol the next day, as Wasps took on holders Toulon, was similar, if not quite as relentlessly raucous. Many Premiership grounds are full, but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best Gallic arenas. The Millennium Stadium when a big Test is on takes some beating, while Thomond Park, Limerick, is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism, closely followed by Ravenhill when Ulster play under lights. Munster's home stadium Thomond Park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere . But Clermont lead the atmosphere league table. It’s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors, but those who haven’t been should try it as neutrals, for a big French Top 14 clash. The place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride. CORBISIERO'S STRUGGLES RAISE DOUBTS . When certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field, there is a particular sense of foreboding. Alex Corbisiero is in that category. The Northampton prop didn’t feature for England during the recent Six Nations and was forced off during the Saints’ thumping defeat at Clermont last weekend, apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee – which has been a problem area before. More recently, the Lions loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at Stade Marcel Michelin. Corbisiero hasn’t started a Test for England for 28 months. His club insist this latest setback is ‘only a bruise’, but there will be grave doubts about this world-class player’s ability to scale the heights again, until he plays regularly without mishap. Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero has not started a game for England in nearly two years . Saints and England lock Courtney Lawes is a doubt for his side's clash with Exeter on Sunday . Courtney Lawes has what Northampton are calling a ‘bad shoulder’ and may not feature in Sunday’s clash with Exeter. There was better news for Saracens on Thursday, as Jacques Burger will be available for their Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont, after escaping with a one-match ban for striking Maxime Machenaud of Racing Metro. LAST WORD . Now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the World Cup, Nigel Owens should just go ahead and book his room in the Twickenham area for the final on October 31. The Welshman is close to being a shoo-in for that showpiece occasion, unless his cause is shattered by Warren Gatland’s national team emerging from the ‘Pool of Death’ and going one step further than they did four years ago. It is no coincidence that Owens has presided over many of the greatest encounters at Test and club level in recent years. Nigel Owens (left) is the frontrunner to referee the World Cup final, unless Wales make it there of course . His empathy, style of communication and desire to let the game flow mean he is respected worldwide. He has acquired a high profile, but it does nothing to detract from his professionalism. Happily, this year’s tournament cannot be tarnished by the attention-seeking antics of Alain Rolland and Steve Walsh, who have both retired. Referees are there to monitor, adjudicate and facilitate, not try to up-stage the teams and players.", "tgt": "Nick Abendanon was sublime in Clermont's 37-5 win against Northampton .

{"id": 36, "src": "The Hunger Games film franchise has grossed over $2 billion after three movies - and the final chapter is due out at the end of the year. Before that, the Twilight saga managed $3.3 billion over five films from 2008. The Avengers garnered $1.5 billion with just one film in 2012, and there are three other sequels to come, with the follow-up hitting cinemas May 1. When it comes to Hollywood's primary concern - banking a major box office - a series or superhero adaptation is largely seen as a surefire success, in a benchmark set in the early 2000's by Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings, and followed by The Pirates Of The Caribbean and Spiderman. However, while original screenplays and independent projects are being edged out and overlooked as a result, there is still a small group of stars considered capable of pulling people into theaters in droves. According to a new survey in The Hollywood Reporter - which called upon producers, agents and executives to list those who can command a major opening based on their fan base -  there are six superstars around that can keep the studios swelling, without having to resort to turning a best-selling book or beloved comic into a picture. In return, they can ask for $20 million per film. 1. Sandra Bullock . The acting favorite, who won an Oscar in 2010 for The Blind Side, topped Forbes' list of the highest-earning actresses in 2014. The Miss Congeniality star took the headline spot thanks to her gripping turn in Gravity, which became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2013, with a global box office of $716 million. And while her buddy cop comedy The Heat with Melissa McCarthy managed similarly impressive numbers, with about $229.9 million worldwide, the powerful pull that Bullock has today is a career-long achievement. Thrillers like Speed, A Time To Kill ,Murder By Numbers and Crash served her well, but Bullock's legion of loyal fans have really followed her quality comedies and dramas - from While You Were Sleeping to Hope Floats, Practical Magic, 28 Days, Two Weeks Notice and The Proposal. Theater favorite: Sandra Bullock has built up an impressive and loyal following over a career spanning almost 30 years. Here she is pictured in 2013's Gravity (left) and Speed in in 1994 (right) Old faithful: Bullock made her name - and continues to - by appearing in feel-good romantic comedies, such as Hope Floats with Harry Connick Jr. in 1998. In it Bullock plays a housewife who moves back to the small town she is from following the collapse of her marriage . 2. Leonardo DiCaprio . For a young guy who started out doing TV ads for Bubble Yum chewing gum in the 1990s, DiCaprio is now 40 and a bona fide movie star. While 1997's Titanic is still ranked as the second highest-grossing film of all time (after Avatar), taking $2.18 billion, he has appeared in some of the largest films of the last 15 years, including Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, The Aviator and, most recently, The Wolf Of Wall St. According to The Richest, his films have grossed an astounding $2.3 billion. Mr blockbuster: Leonardo DiCaprio asked for $25 million up front to appear as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street (left), according to reports. His is pictured out and about in New York in September 2014 (right) 3. Matt Damon . He is perhaps best-known for the Bourne spy series, which spawned three films from 2002. And, despite a shaky return once the series wrapped up, with the disappointing performances of The Adjustment Bureau, Margaret, Invictus, Green Zone, We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land, Damon showed once more he is a leading man when not playing Jason Bourne. End-of-the-world blockbuster Elysium became a big movie for Sony in 2013, not just for its global takings of $286 million, but for being an original screenplay - a follow-up to Neill Blomkamp's sleeper hit District 9 - and not an adaptation. However the big money will come in 2016, when he reprises his role as Bourne. Leading man: Matt Damon - pictured left with his wife Luciana Barroso - made a big comeback in 2013 with sci-fi hit Elysium (right) 4. Robert Downey Jr. This comeback king put a shocking bout of arrests, rehab and prison behind him when he played unconventional superhero Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man. He followed it up in 2009 by appearing as the title role in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and then its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, in 2011. Iron Man 2 proved another major hit in 2010, and then the character appeared in The Avengers in 2012, before Iron Man 3 broke office records in 2013, collecting $1.2 billion. Downey Jr. now has an estimated net worth of $190 million, and is said to be on the best pay packet of all the actors who are signed on to The Avenger's. Comeback king: Robert Downey Jr. has played Iron Man in three installments, plus The Avengers franchise, all of which has a big pay pack . 5. Angelina Jolie . She won an Oscar for playing a disturbingly violent inmate of a female mental institution in 1999's Girl, Interrupted, before going to refashion herself as a leading action star, with roles in Gone In 60 Seconds, Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith, The Wanted and Salt. While her most recent film, Unbroken, featured her as director, the Disney live-action flick Maleficent became the fourth highest-grossing film of 2014, taking $758 million. The actress was paid a reported $15 million for the Sleeping Beauty remake, and is set to make $20 million for the Salt sequel. Regardless of the film, if Jolie is in it, audiences will go see it. Action star: While last year's Maleficent was a big box office hit, Jolie is expected to collect $20 for the Salt sequel . 6. Denzel Washington . Two-time Academy Award nominee Denzel Washington has a career that is as diverse as it is spread out. From Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X in 1992, to boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter The Hurricane and football coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans, he moved into a series of action roles, including Training Day, Man On Fire and American Gangster. But his portrayed of an alcoholic but brilliant commerical pilot who prevents a catastrophic plane crash in Flight is the most memorable of late. Washington is believed to have been paid $20 million - $10 million more than co-star Mark Wahlberg - for the 2013 film 2 Guns. According to The Hollywood Reporter survey, however, there is a separate list of actors who are not far behind this list. The second group are said to be able to command $15 million each per picture. In order, that list goes Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum.

{"id": 37, "src": "(CNN)Since the headline-grabbing murder of American journalist James Foley by ISIS militants eight months ago, the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient, primally horrifying method of execution. British and American aid workers, Japanese and American journalists, Kurdish and Syrian soldiers and Egyptian and now Ethiopian Christians were among those who followed in Foley's wake: their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience. These highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the ISIS cause. But beyond this, some experts such as psychology professor Arie W. Kruglanski suggest, the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knock-on effect. He says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copy-cat acts or threats of decapitation -- not only from Islamists, but from the \"disbelievers\" they target. Kruglanski, distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, says the frequent, high profile reports of ISIS beheadings could result in psychologically \"priming\" people to be more inclined to emulate them, or threaten to, during moments of conflict or extreme stress. Because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally, \"the very concept of beheading, that was virtually non-existent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated, is now there,\" he told CNN. \"It comes to mind when a conflict happens, when you react aggressively,\" he said. \"It sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high, and result in actual behavior.\" Reports of beheadings also emerge from Saudi Arabia, where it is a legal method of execution under the country's judicial code; and Mexico and Brazil, where it is typically the work of criminal gangs. But neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as ISIS's propaganda, in which the threat is extended to \"disbelievers\" around the globe. A similar copy-cat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings, said Kruglanski. \"Once the idea is planted then when someone is upset, feeling violent, the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind, because it's sitting there in our unconscious,\" he said. A lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by non-jihadists more often. But reports of such cases have been frequently making the headlines. In December and January, two victims were decapitated -- outside a Florida home, and in a shopping mall in China's Shaanxi province -- in crimes with no apparent connection to terror. In London alone, a city deeply impacted by the murder and attempted decapitation of soldier Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists in 2013, three women were reportedly beheaded last year in alleged crimes with no apparent jihadist motivation. And in the United States, an Oklahoma man is awaiting trial, accused of beheading a co-worker in September. (Whether he was inspired by ISIS propaganda remains unclear; he was reportedly a recent convert to Islam and had posted Osama bin Laden and beheading content online.) Whether or not \"non-jihadist\" beheadings are on the increase, this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness, as ISIS's beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror group's call on supporters to attack \"disbelievers\" has reverberated worldwide. In Australia and the Philippines, jihad-related threats or plots to decapitate have allegedly been made in the past seven months; recently, a Muslim convert in London was found guilty of a plot to behead a British soldier, inspired by the Rigby murder. The theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in Belgium in January, where fans of football team Standard Liege unfurled a giant banner depicting the severed head of an opponent. The club condemned their actions as \"totally unacceptable.\" Beyond this, threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among non-jihadists, said Kruglanski. In the U.S., a Michigan man was arrested in January for threatening to decapitate the New York police officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal choke hold, which triggered widespread civil rights protests. And months earlier, in October, police reportedly received a threat to behead elementary school students in Rhode Island. Roderic Broadhurst, a professor of crime, policing, security and justice at the Australian National University said the ISIS beheadings may have shown those engaging in attention-seeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed. \"An awareness of what really shocks and gets 'news' is clearly on show,\" he said. The threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically \"brutalizing\" effect on society, said Kruglanski, intensifying the violence of our thoughts, words and actions. \"Ultimately, we're talking about contributing to the brutalization of interpersonal and inter-group conflict all over the planet,\" he said. Justin Hastings, a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the University of Sydney, said that while ISIS beheadings \"might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others,\" he believed it would eventually fall out of favor. While beheading had been adopted by ISIS as their stock in trade, it would inevitably lose its shock value, driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention. One such dramatic escalation occurred in February, when ISIS released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors -- burning Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh alive in a cage. Later that month, ISIS released a video released showing what appeared to be Kurdish Peshmerga fighters paraded down Iraqi streets in cages. For many, a baffling aspect to the executions has been how such overweening brutality could win support for the ISIS cause. While the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent, Kruglanski said, they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting \"a sense of godlike power.\" \"We all have this morbid, instinctual fascination with death and killing and torture, which is sublimated and constrained by civilization and our culture and socialization,\" he said. \"Most of us are peaceful even though these drives exist in our subconscious; civilization rests on its ability to constrain them.\" But when the \"death instinct\" -- \"this drive to kill and promote violence\" -- was legitimized by a powerful narrative, such as a religious or ideological call to global jihad, \"then that can result in unregulated atrocities,\" he said. For some foreign jihadists who had traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight for ISIS, the realities of the so-called \"Islamic State\" had driven them to return home disenchanted, he said. But others remained. \"In each of us there is this battle of good versus evil,\" said Kruglanski. \"It's a battle in everybody's soul.\"", "tgt": "The wave of ISIS beheadings has horrified people all over the world . It may also have contributed to isolated beheading incidents by non-jihadists, says an academic . Professor Arie W.

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring . The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend . It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring . Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat . In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

{"id": 39, "src": "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.", "tgt": "In a few years, the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers because of America's obesity problem .

Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.", "tgt": "Manchester United could still sign Radamel Falcao permanently .

{"id": 41, "src": "St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (CNN)Government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the Virgin Islands who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide. Local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in different parts of the island; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013, without his knowledge. Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the Sirenusa resort, where a Delaware family's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare. Theresa Devine and Steve Esmond and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures; two brothers, ages 14 and 16, remain in comas. But this was likely not an isolated incident. Local authorities here tell CNN there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated Sirenusa resort on St. John by the pest control company Terminix.  They also say Terminix used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions. Dawn Henry, the commissioner designee of the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources, or DPNR, said that while investigating what happened, the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same Sirenusa resort, as well as in a vacation villa in St. Croix and in two nontourist locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use, and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was. \"What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they'll be held accountable for it,\"  Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013, but said there have been no additional reports of people falling ill. Authorities are trying to track down anyone who has stayed at the affected villas or who might have been exposed. Family slowly recovering from illness after Virgin Islands trip . Terminix issued a statement saying it is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" When CNN visited the Terminix office on St. Thomas, which is corporate-owned, an employee refused to comment, and another employee closed the door. Henry said all canisters of methyl bromide known to exist in the area have been confiscated and will be shipped off-island for destruction as soon as possible. In the meantime, an attorney for Esmond and Devine said the family is still struggling. The two teenage boys remain in comas. Their father has regained consciousness and is slowly getting better. Devine is in better condition and is undergoing occupational therapy. DPNR, the local environmental agency, already had been under scrutiny. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight, designated it \"high risk,\" saying the agency \"does not meet management standards.\" The EPA's inspector general is also investigating. According to the Department of Justice, a former commissioner and two DPNR directors have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, Dean C. Plaskett  was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts. In 2014, Roberto Tapia, the Justice Department said, pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of that same agency.  He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. In January, Mapp was sworn in and appointed Henry as a new designee to run the department, so it is under a new administration. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. She added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement, but instead general practices. Mapp said the agency's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the Devine and Esmond's family. Instead, he blames the pesticide companies. \"It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it, and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,\" Mapp said. Part of the investigation, he said, will be tracking whether the proper paperwork was filled out when the canisters were ordered, or if the pesticide was smuggled in. The Department of Justice is also investigating. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.", "tgt": "Methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, local officials say .

Remarkably, Kinnear was manager of the month in September 1993, March 1994 and then April 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in Septmber 1996. Given Ferguson's dominance, it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list. Wenger's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall, the same as Liverpool. Newcastle United aren't far behind with 13, followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11. English managers dominate the list looking back, with 75 managers from this country having won the prize.

{"id": 49, "src": "Duke was not the only big winner following Monday's NCAA championship game. In an upset even more surprising than the Blue Devils victory over the slightly favored Wisconsin Badgers, Sam Holtz, a 12-year-old sixth grader from Lake Zurich, Illinois, beat out 11.5million entries to win the annual ESPN Tournament Challenge. And for this impressive feat, Sam gets bragging rights and an amazing sense of accomplishment. But not the actual grand prize of a $20,000 Best Buy gift card and an all-inclusive trip for two to the Maui Jim Maui Invitational college basketball tournament in Hawaii this November. For that prize, valued at $30,000, Sam would have to legally be an adult as contest rules state individuals must be at least 18-years-old to qualify. Scroll down for video . Sam Holtz (above) beat out 11.5million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge on Monday . This as he selected Duke (above) to win the NCAA title game, which they did by overcoming the favorite Wisconsin badgers 68 - 63 . 'It feels really, like, exciting and I feel pretty cool right now for winning it because it’s a really hard thing to do,' Sam told ABC News. 'I was just talking to ESPN and they said that I’m underage and can’t get any of the prize and they’re going to send some goodies even though I entered under my dad’s consent, which I’m pretty irritated about.' That being said, like any enterprising child, Sam does have an idea for the folks at ESPN as it pertains to compensation for his historic fete. 'For ESPN, I came in first and this was a rare thing that you can rarely get and I still don’t get anything and I think I deserve something out of it,' Sam said. 'Even if I just get an Xbox or something.' Sam's plan may not work however, as it would have taken a second amazing feat for him to actually win the prize, with the top 1percent of entries being entered for a random drawing, which in this case would put his odds at roughly 1 in 115,000. As for his strategy, Sam seemed to adopt a seldom seen cool and relaxed approach when it came to making his picks, and says he was barely even aware how well he was doing. 'I didn’t really pay attention to my bracket until the Final Four when I went on my phone and realized, \"Woah, I’m in sixth place,\"' said Sam. 'Then I zoned into those games and realized, \"Hey, I have a chance here.\"' Sam should now be eligible for the $30,000 grand prize of a $20,000 Best Buy gift card and an all-inclusive trip to Hawaii this November, but is too young . He's got it: With a few minor exceptions, Sam picked a remarkably accurate bracket who was, including 100percent correct from the Elite Eight onward. He only had two teams wrong in the Sweet 16 . Sam is not the only winner going home empty handed either, as under NCAA guidelines college athletes cannot accept any forms of payment or gifts, which means the boys from Duke also head home with no prize money or Xboxes. Though, to put things in perspective, Sam had to deal with approximately 11,499,936 more competitors than any of the teams in the tournament. Sam is also helping out all those adults who obsessed over their brackets and then became irrationally angry as their teams lost by offering some helpful tips to make next year better. 'Just pick the team that you like and pick whoever you want,' he said. 'You never know what’s going to happen in March Madness so just pick teams that you really like.' ESPN might be smart to give the level-headed kid who knows his college basketball a job as a commentator at next year's tournament instead of that Xbox. Assuming he is old enough.", "tgt": "Sam Holtz beat out 11.5million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge on Monday .

Sam says he does not mind missing the prize, and though he is a little 'irritated' he thinks the best idea if for ESPN to reward him with an Xbox .
